    "\n",
    "Well that really depends. So common problems are:\n",

    "- Plots don't change when they should be\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Is the website images staying the same, or are the actual local plots not changing?\n",
    "--> if you said only website images, than you need to delete the html files in website dir and re-run. We are working on having it do this automatically in the next version.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regridded CAM vs Obs seems to freeze/takes forever\n",
    "-> this will definitely happen and is suggested to run on a compute node if on NCAR/CISL machines. Depending on the simulation case, it can take several hours, so beware!\n",
