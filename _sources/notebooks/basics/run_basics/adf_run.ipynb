    "Running the ADF via Jupyter has a few more steps than through the terminal, but it has several advantages over running it via terminal. Most importantly, it is much more flexible inside a Jupyter notebook; the user can pull out specific pieces of the ADF, the user can also piggy back custom diagnostics in the same notebook as the ADF run. This last point is powerful because once the ADF has run in the notebook, the user has access to all the ojects that come out of the ADF, such as file locations, case names, climo years, etc."
